# Create patch/diff files when given 2 versions of source code from git repositories.
# Diff files are created for only those files which are available in both
# ../changes/ and the first git source location.
# For example, dir1 is the first git source location for stable/mitaka 13.1.0 tag and
# dir2 is git source location for stable/mitaka 13.3.5 tag. Then this script traverses
# through the files available in ../changes directory (and subdirectroies recursively)
# and creates diff files for every such file that is found under dir1 (including
# subdirectories of dir1 recursively).
#
# Example usage: ./versionDiff.sh /tmp/.gitsrc_13.1.0 /tmp/.gitsrc_13.3.5
#
# You can use mkdiffs.py to get .gitsrc_13.1.0 and .gitsrc_13.3.5 by running
# mkdiffs.py twice, once with 13.1.0 in mkdiffs.yml and second time with 13.3.5 in
# mkdiffs.yml. When mkdiffs.py is run, the generated .gitsrc directory is located
# at ../.gitsrc
#
#
# Usual steps in porting os-services to a new OSA version:
# (1) Run mkdiffs.py to get old OSA version git source code and then save it.
#       ./mkdiffs
#       cp -R ../.gitsrc ~/gitsrc_v1
# (2) Modify the version/tag of different(all) roles in mkdiffs.yml to the
#     new version from old version. Run mkdiffs.py again to get the new
#     version's .gitsrc and save that also.
#       ./mkdiffs
#       cp -R ../.gitsrc ~/gitsrc_v2
# (3) Run versionDiff.sh to get the differences between gitsrc_v1 and
#     gitsrc_v2 for the files under ../changes/
#       ./versionDiff.sh ~/gitsrc_v1 ~/gitsrc_v2
#     Choose c[to apply cleanly applicable patches only] or a[to apply all
#     patches; some of these will result in .rej files, which require
#     manual attention/merge]
# (4) Once all the code changes to ../changes/ are done, run mkdiffs.py to get
#     the patch files in ../.diffs directory. Copy the required .patch files
#     from ../.diffs/ to ../osa/diffs/
#     Refer to the next point (5) that helps in deciding which patch files are
#     to be copied from ../.diffs/ to ../osa/diffs/ and also in copying
#     automatically.
# (5) Once the porting is completed (including manually merging all the
#     patches from ../.versionDiffOutput/ to ../changes), run cmpDiffs.sh
#     which helps in copying the patch files from ../.diffs to ../osa/diffs
#     after prompting for y/n for copying:
#       ./cmpDiffs.sh ../.diffs ../osa/diffs
#     If there are differences shown in the log file /tmp/cmpDiffs.log and
#     if we choose option y in y/n for copying patch files from ../.diffs to
#     ../osa/diffs, then rerun cmpDiffs.sh to validate that there are no
#     more differences between the patches from ../.diffs and ../osa/diffs.
#     The resultant log file /tmp/cmpDiffs.log should not contain any
#     differences. The following command should give empty output if porting
#     of os-services to new version is complete:
#     grep -v -e 'FILE:' -e 'No differences between' /tmp/cmpDiffs.log
# (6) Make any other related changes like the release name change in the line
#     that has "git checkout" and the value of OSA_TAG variable in
#     ../osa/scripts/bootstrap-osa.sh
# (7) You may have to remove patches from ../osa/diffs/ if the corresponding
#     source file is removed from a subdirectory under os-services/changes/ as
#     part of porting os-services from one version of OSA to another.
